  "saravanan": "Hello Saravanan,\n\nAs you probably know by now, I’m leaving Kinettix and before I go, I just really wanted to say something to you.\n\nThank you. Honestly, thank you for everything.\n\nFrom the very beginning, you’ve been more than just a team lead/manager to me. You’ve been a mentor, someone I looked up to and learned so much from. Your guidance and support helped me grow not just as a tester, but as a person. You believed in me, even during times I doubted myself. That kind of trust meant a lot.\n\nYou’ve always treated us like family, scolding us when needed, pushing us to do better, not because you were being hard on us, but because you genuinely cared. I’ve always felt that. And I’ve always respected you deeply for it.\n\nEven though we’ve never met in person, I always felt your presence in the team. Your leadership, your guidance, and your care were always there and that made a big difference.\n\nI’ve never seen you as just an office mate or a boss. To me, you’ve always been more than that. I’ll carry the lessons you taught me wherever I go, and I’ll always be grateful for the time I got to work with you.\n\nI won’t forget you, and I wish you all the best always.\n\nTake care always – Ramon",
  "devs": "Hello Dev Team,\n\nBefore my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank all of you.\n\nWorking with such a smart, passionate, and collaborative group of developers has been one of the highlights of my time at Kinettix. I’ve learned so much from observing how each of you approaches challenges, solves problems, and constantly pushes to improve the system.\n\nThank you for being open to feedback, for the knowledge sharing, and for the day-to-day support, whether it was reviewing a ticket, jumping on a quick call to debug, or just checking in. You’ve made QA work smoother and more meaningful.\n\nI genuinely appreciated being part of this team, and I’m proud of everything we’ve accomplished together. Keep building amazing things, keep learning, and keep supporting each other.\n\nWishing all of you continued growth and success, both professionally and personally.\n\nSalamat and all the best - Ramon",
  "margaux": "Hello Margaux,\n\nBefore my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for joining the team. Even though we only had a short time working together, I’ve already seen the impact you’ve made.\n\nYou may be new to the team and still gaining experience in testing, but your attitude, dedication, and willingness to learn have truly stood out. I’ve worked with many talented QAs before, and I can confidently say, you have those same qualities.\n\nMy advice moving forward is simple: keep learning. You’ve already started building a strong foundation and a good understanding of our product and system. You bring fresh perspectives, openness to feedback, and a real drive to grow—use all of that to your advantage.\n\nYou’ve taken great steps in manual testing, and now that you’re starting to explore automation, I can already see a bright future ahead for you. Absorb all the knowledge and experiences that come your way. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s how we grow. Use those moments to become even better.\n\nI have high hopes for you, Margaux. I truly believe you’ll go far and achieve even more than I did. And who knows, maybe someday our paths will cross again, and by then, you’ll be leading the QA team yourself.\n\nWishing you all the best in your journey ahead.\n\nTake care – Ramon",
  "albert": "Hello Mac,\n\nBefore my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you.\n\nIt’s truly been great working with someone as talented and dependable as you. We may not have talked often, but whenever we did, our conversations were always meaningful, and through those moments, I got to know the kind of person you are.\n\nYou’re excellent at what you do—skilled, driven, and always striving to make things better. I’m really glad I had the chance to work with someone like you, not as a QA, not as a developer, but as a dedicated and sharp IT Helpdesk Manager who made a real difference to the whole Kinettix organization.\n\nI still remember when I interviewed you—even back then, I had a feeling you were the right person for the role. And you’ve gone above and beyond that expectation ever since.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to work with you and get to know you. It’s truly been a pleasure having you as a teammate. Let me know if you're visiting Cebu, I will be glad to meet you.\n\nWishing you all the best – Ramon",
  "keziah": "Hello Keziah,\n\nBefore my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.\n\nWe may have sat in the same room without many personal conversations, but even in that quiet space, I learned a lot just by observing you. The way you carry yourself, how you lead your team, and the calm confidence you bring to your work—it all made an impression on me. You and Kriff have both been sources of quiet inspiration for me, and part of the reason I always strived to do my best.\n\nI’ve always felt the respect you had for me, and I truly hope you felt the same from me. It was a pleasure working alongside you, and I’m genuinely grateful for the small conversations we shared—they meant more than you might think.\n\nGood luck and congratulations on your upcoming blessing!

You took the lead in helping them understand Dispatch1 and how to manage tickets effectively. You were a great mentor, and because of your support, they were able to quickly grasp the application.\n\nYou’ve always made time to train others, even when you were busy with your own tasks and leading your team — and that didn’t go unnoticed. You truly deserved every MVP vote from me and from the DevOps team. Your effort, patience, and dedication made a real impact, and I deeply appreciate it.\n\nI’m genuinely grateful I had the chance to work with someone as talented and committed as you.\n\nWishing you continued success in everything you do.\n\nAll the best - Ramon",

While we may not have always seen eye to eye, I’ve always respected you—as a teammate, a fellow QA, and most of all, as a thoughtful contributor to the team.\n\nOur app and processes wouldn’t be where they are today without your insights and efforts. We’ve grown together—from manual testing to automation—and I’ve genuinely appreciated that journey.\n\nIf I could leave you with one piece of advice: keep learning. You already have a strong foundation and a deep understanding of the system. Now is your time to step up and lead. You’ve got the openness, the curiosity, and the ability to make a real impact.\n\nI have high hopes for you, Mat. I believe you’ll achieve even more than I did.

  "craig": "Hello Craig,\n\nBefore my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.\n\nWe may not have had many conversations or a long time working together, but to be honest, ever since you joined the team, I felt like we were finally heading in the right direction. We’ve had leads before—Alex, Saravanan, and Clay—but something felt different when you came onboard. Your presence brought clarity, momentum, and a sense of alignment that I had long been hoping for.\n\nAs a QA, I’ve always done my best, especially when it comes to improving the user experience. But for a while, I felt like those efforts weren’t always seen or acted upon. When you arrived, it felt like the missing piece of the puzzle was finally in place. In such a short time, we were able to deliver strong features and fix long-standing issues, and that’s largely thanks to your leadership.\n\nI’ve worked with other project managers before, but I can honestly say you’re one of the best. Your approach, skills, and dedication really stood out and helped solve so many problems the team had been facing.\n\nI’m honestly a bit sad that our time working together was so short, but I’m truly grateful I had the chance to collaborate with someone as capable and driven as you.\n\nWishing you and the team continued success.\n\nAll the best – Ramon",
