     saravanan: `Hello Saravanan,

As you probably know by now, Iâ€™m leaving Kinettix and before I go, I just really wanted to say something to you.

Thank you. Honestly, thank you for everything.

From the very beginning, youâ€™ve been more than just a team lead/manager to me. Youâ€™ve been a mentor, someone I looked up to and learned so much from. Your guidance and support helped me grow not just as a tester, but as a person. You believed in me, even during times I doubted myself. That kind of trust meant a lot.

Youâ€™ve always treated us like family, scolding us when needed, pushing us to do better, not because you were being hard on us, but because you genuinely cared. Iâ€™ve always felt that. And Iâ€™ve always respected you deeply for it.

Even though weâ€™ve never met in person, I always felt your presence in the team. Your leadership, your guidance, and your care were always there and that made a big difference.

Iâ€™ve never seen you as just an office mate or a boss. To me, youâ€™ve always been more than that. Iâ€™ll carry the lessons you taught me wherever I go, and Iâ€™ll always be grateful for the time I got to work with you.

I wonâ€™t forget you, and I wish you all the best always.

Take care always â€“ Ramon`,

	devs: `Hello Dev Team,

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank all of you.

Working with such a smart, passionate, and collaborative group of developers has been one of the highlights of my time at Kinettix. Iâ€™ve learned so much from observing how each of you approaches challenges, solves problems, and constantly pushes to improve the system.

Thank you for being open to feedback, for the knowledge sharing, and for the day-to-day support, whether it was reviewing a ticket, jumping on a quick call to debug, or just checking in. Youâ€™ve made QA work smoother and more meaningful.

I genuinely appreciated being part of this team, and Iâ€™m proud of everything weâ€™ve accomplished together. Keep building amazing things, keep learning, and keep supporting each other.

Wishing all of you continued growth and success, both professionally and personally.

Salamat and all the best - Ramon`,

      margaux: `Hello Margaux,

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for joining the team. Even though we only had a short time working together, Iâ€™ve already seen the impact youâ€™ve made.

You may be new to the team and still gaining experience in testing, but your attitude, dedication, and willingness to learn have truly stood out. Iâ€™ve worked with many talented QAs before, and I can confidently say, you have those same qualities.

My advice moving forward is simple: keep learning. Youâ€™ve already started building a strong foundation and a good understanding of our product and system. You bring fresh perspectives, openness to feedback, and a real drive to grow, use all of that to your advantage.

Youâ€™ve taken great steps in manual testing, and now that youâ€™re starting to explore automation, I can already see a bright future ahead for you. Absorb all the knowledge and experiences that come your way. Donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes, thatâ€™s how we grow. Use those moments to become even better.

I have high hopes for you, Margaux. I truly believe youâ€™ll go far and achieve even more than I did. And who knows, maybe someday our paths will cross again, and by then, youâ€™ll be leading the QA team yourself.

Wishing you all the best in your journey ahead .

Take care â€“ Ramon`,

      albert: `Hello Mac,

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you.

Itâ€™s truly been great working with someone as talented and dependable as you. We may not have talked often, but whenever we did, our conversations were always meaningful, and through those moments, I got to know the kind of person you are.

Youâ€™re excellent at what you do, skilled, driven, and always striving to make things better. Iâ€™m really glad I had the chance to work with someone like you, not as a QA, not as a developer, but as a dedicated and sharp IT Helpdesk Manager who made a real difference to the whole Kinettix organization.

I still remember when I interviewed you, even back then, I had a feeling you were the right person for the role. And youâ€™ve gone above and beyond that expectation ever since.

Thank you again for the opportunity to work with you and get to know you. Itâ€™s truly been a pleasure having you as a teammate. Let me know if you're visiting Cebu, I will be glad to meet you.

Wishing you all the best â€“ Ramon`,

      keziah: `Hello Keziah,

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.

We may have sat in the same room without many personal conversations, but even in that quiet space, I learned a lot just by observing you. The way you carry yourself, how you lead your team, and the calm confidence you bring to your work, it all made an impression on me. You and Kriff have both been sources of quiet inspiration for me, and part of the reason I always strived to do my best.

Iâ€™ve always felt the respect you had for me, and I truly hope you felt the same from me. It was a pleasure working alongside you, and Iâ€™m genuinely grateful for the small conversations we shared, they meant more than you might think.

Good luck and congratulations on your upcoming blessing! Wishing you and your growing family all the love and joy in the world.

Take care â€“ Ramon`,

      cecilio: `Hello Cecilio,

First of all â€” congratulations!

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.

Before the training team was formed, the DevOps team was truly grateful for your help in guiding our developers and testers. You took the lead in helping them understand Dispatch1 and how to manage tickets effectively. You were a great mentor, and because of your support, they were able to quickly grasp the application.

Youâ€™ve always made time to train others, even when you were busy with your own tasks and leading your team â€” and that didnâ€™t go unnoticed. You truly deserved every MVP vote from me and from the DevOps team. Your effort, patience, and dedication made a real impact, and I deeply appreciate it.

Iâ€™m genuinely grateful I had the chance to work with someone as talented and committed as you.

Wishing you continued success in everything you do.

All the best - Ramon`,

      clay: `Hi Clay,

As I approach my last working day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.

Working with you has been one of the most meaningful parts of my journey here. Youâ€™ve been more than just a manager, youâ€™ve been a mentor and a friend. Iâ€™ve learned a lot under your leadership, and Iâ€™m genuinely grateful for the trust, support, and opportunities youâ€™ve given me.

Thank you for always being approachable, for believing in my capabilities, and for guiding me through both challenges and growth. Your steady leadership and genuine care for the team have made a lasting impact on me.

Iâ€™m proud of what weâ€™ve accomplished together, and Iâ€™ll carry those experiences with me moving forward. Iâ€™ll always look back on this chapter with gratitude.

Wishing you and the team continued success and I truly hope our paths cross again someday.

      matthew: `Hello Mat,

Before my last day, I want to thank you for your support and for trusting me in my leadership role. While we may not have always shared the same point of view, I want you to know that Iâ€™ve always respected you, both as a person and as a talented QA.

Our application and processes wouldnâ€™t be where they are today without your contributions. Weâ€™ve grown together, from manual testers to automation developers, and itâ€™s been a journey Iâ€™ve truly appreciated.

My advice to you moving forward is simple: keep learning. You already have a strong foundation and deep understanding of our product and system. Now is your time to step up and lead. I genuinely believe you have what it takes, fresh perspectives, openness to ideas, and the drive to grow. Use all of that to your advantage, and youâ€™ll find yourself on the right path.

I have high hopes for you, Mat. I believe youâ€™ll achieve even more than I did. And who knows, maybe someday our paths will cross again, and by then, youâ€™ll be the one managing the whole QA team.

Wishing you all the best in your journey ahead.

Take care â€“ Ramon`,

      alex: `Hello Alex,

Before my last day, I just wanted to say something from the heart.

Thank you for all the support youâ€™ve given me, and thank you for the trust. Youâ€™re a talented developer and a strong leader. Iâ€™ve seen how youâ€™ve handled the team, always doing your best to support everyone, and I truly respect that.

Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with other great developers before, and I can honestly say youâ€™re one of them. Your technical skills, calm approach, and dedication stand out. Keep growing, and always follow what your heart tells you, youâ€™re already a great leader, but I believe youâ€™re capable of doing so much more with your expertise and talent.

Even though weâ€™ve never met in person, I never saw you as just a colleague. To me, youâ€™ve been more than that. Iâ€™m genuinely glad our paths crossed, and I got the chance to work with someone as talented as you.

Wishing you continued success and all the best in everything you do.

Hope to meet you when you visit here in Cebu.

Take care â€“ Ramon`,

      craig: `Hello Craig,

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.

We may not have had many conversations or a long time working together, but to be honest, ever since you joined the team, I felt like we were finally heading in the right direction. Weâ€™ve had leads before, Alex, Saravanan, and Clay, but something felt different when you came onboard. Your presence brought clarity, momentum, and a sense of alignment that I had long been hoping for.

As a QA, Iâ€™ve always done my best, especially when it comes to improving the user experience. But for a while, I felt like those efforts werenâ€™t always seen or acted upon. When you arrived, it felt like the missing piece of the puzzle was finally in place. In such a short time, we were able to deliver strong features and fix long standing issues and thatâ€™s largely thanks to your leadership.

Iâ€™ve worked with other project managers before, but I can honestly say youâ€™re one of the best. Your approach, skills, and dedication really stood out and helped solve so many problems the team had been facing.

Iâ€™m honestly a bit sad that our time working together was so short, but Iâ€™m truly grateful I had the chance to collaborate with someone as capable and driven as you.

Wishing you and the team continued success.

All the best â€“ Ramon`,

     chad: `Hello Chad,

Before my last day, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you.

Iâ€™ve always admired you as a supportive and inspiring CEO. Your openness, vision, and leadership have made a strong impact on me and shaped how meaningful it has been to be part of this organization. Iâ€™ve never met a CEO as down to earth, thoughtful, and genuinely smart as you. Through your direction and goals, I was inspired to give my best, to contribute in any way I could, whether it was improving the applications, processes, or even the little things around the office.

Iâ€™ve always treated Kinettix like it was my own company, which is why I became so deeply attached not just to the work, but to the purpose behind it. I wanted to improve the user experience, support others, and help wherever and whenever I could.

Iâ€™m proud to have worn many hats during my time here, QA, Scrum Master, DevOps Manager, IT Operations Manager, and QA Manager. Itâ€™s been an incredible journey, and Iâ€™m truly honored by the trust that was placed in me. Iâ€™m especially grateful to you and to Clay for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to step into these roles. Those experiences not only helped me grow professionally but also deepened my commitment to the team and to the companyâ€™s success.

For years, Iâ€™ve been fully committed, focused on the work, supporting the team, and growing with the company. Serving as QA Manager has been a true honor. Iâ€™m proud of what weâ€™ve accomplished, and Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for the trust and support youâ€™ve given me throughout the journey.

Thank you for believing in me, for the opportunity to grow, and for creating a place where people like me could thrive.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for supporting my magic tricks. Thank you for all the cards you have given me. I will treasure those gifts and forever be grateful.

I also want to thank you for hiring me and for all the support, advice, and understanding youâ€™ve extended throughout my time here. Leading a team has its challenges, especially when it comes to personal matters, but it became manageable because I always felt your trust and guidance behind me.
